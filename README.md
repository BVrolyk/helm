# Helm - The Kubernetes Package Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deis/helm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deis/helm)

Helm helps you bootstrap your Kubernetes cluster with **Charts** that provide ready-to-use workloads like:

- A Postgres database
- A scale-out etcd cluster
- An HAProxy Edge Load Balancer

A Chart is a unit of Kubernetes manifests that reflect best practices as determined by the Helm community.  Helm's [architecture](docs/architecture.md) is heavily influenced by [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew).

## Work in Progress

`helm` is changing quickly. Your feedback and participation are more than welcome, but be aware that this project is considered a work in progress.

## Install Helm

To install helm for daily use, you will need the Go 1.5 runtime. Once
that is installed and `$GOPATH` is set, you can run the following:

```console
$ go get github.com/deis/helm/...
```

This will install `helm` into `$GOPATH/bin/helm`.

## Using Helm

To use Helm you'll need a `kubectl` client installed and configured to speak with a running Kubernetes cluster.

To quickly install a standalone etcd instance:

```
$ helm update
---> Fetching updates...
---> Done
$ helm search etcd
	etcd-standalone: etcd-standalone is a single Etcd instance (no cluster)
	etcd-ha-cluster: an HA Etcd cluster (3+ pods)
	etcd-discovery:  a single-pod Etcd service discovery server
$ helm info etcd-standalone
	Description: etcd-standalone is a single Etcd instance (no cluster)
	Version: 2.2.0-beta3
	Website: https://github.com/coreos/etcd
	Built: Oct. 21, 2015
	Provides: etcd-rc.yaml etcd-service.yaml
$ helm install etcd-standalone
---> Downloading etcd-standalone-2.2.0-beta3
---> Cached files into $HELM_WORKDIR/charts/etcd-standalone/
---> Running kubectl create -f ...
---> Done
```

To fetch, customize and install the same chart:

```
$ helm update
---> Fetching updates...
---> Done
$ helm fetch etcd-standalone etcd
---> Downloading etcd-standalone-2.2.0-beta3
---> Cached files into $HELM_WORKDIR/charts/etcd/
---> Done
$ helm edit etcd
$ helm install etcd
---> Found etcd in $HELM_WORKDIR/charts/etcd/ ...
---> Running kubectl create -f ...
```

## Contributing

Helm charts are developed as part of a community effort.  To contribute:

1. Fork Helm
2. `helm create foo && helm edit foo`
3. `git checkout -b foo`
4. `git add $HELM_WORKDIR/charts/foo && git commit && git push`
5. Submit a Pull Request

For helm Go developers, we suggest installing
[glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) and then running `make
build` or `make install`.
